Some people think living in big cities is bad for people’s health. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Nowdays more and more people prefer living in small cities, because they think living in small cities is good for their health. I don't agree with that opinion. I think living in big cities is also good for people's health.

Firstly, big cities have better health conditions than small cities. Big cities have more and better hospitals. Serious diseases like cancer in a small city hospital is ~incurable~**treatmentable**. You still need to go to these famous hospitals in big cities when you're suffering from a serious disease.

Secondly, people in big cities can get a better education, so most of them will have good health habits in **their** diet and fitness, ~and they care~**They care more** about their health in their everyday life.

Thirdly, they can get more opportunities to ~get~**obtain** these ~jobs what they really want to do~**good jobs** in big cities. Although there ~are~**is** a lot of pressure, it is worth ~to tolerate~**tolerating**. And they can earn more money to receive a good education and take care of themselves.
Moreover...  because they earn more money, they can receive a good education and take care of themselves.

Last, with the development of industrialization, heavy industry will shift from big cities to small cities. So the environment of these small cities will become worse. It will be bad for people's health.

In conclusion, living in big cities is good for people's health.

Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions
Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious and short. We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength;
Such is the natural life of a pig. But no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end. You young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one of you will scream your lives out at the block within a year.

When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Many people choose their job based on the salary. But I don't agree **with** the opinion that the salary is the most important consideration when choosing a job, because i believe that many other factors are equally important.

On one hand, I agree the salary is ~the~**an** important consideration. We have to earn enough money to live comfortably and support our family. For example, we need money to pay for bills, food, education and so on. If we don't consider the salary and get a low-income job, maybe we can't cover our needs and even ~the~ basic life **needs** can't be guaranteed. ~So~**Therefore** the salary is important when we choose a new job.

On the other hand, I disagree **that** the salary is most important. Firstly, we always say "do what you love, and love what you do". In my opinion, we should choose a job which we like. We will spend more time ~to~**on** our jobs and try our best to do ~it~**them** well ~due to~**because** we love our jobs. In the end the company will pay us enough money because of our good job. Secondly, many people think the skills they learn or the position they can reach is more important than the salary. Finally the relationship between colleagues and **the** working environment is also very important. These things will make our work more enjoyable.

In conclusion, unless the salary certainly ~affect~**affects** people’s choice of profession, I do not believe that money outweighs all other factors.

薪水是选择工作的一个考量，需要养家糊口，是必不可少的一部分，但薪水差不多，不需要太顾虑的话，还是有很多可以去考虑的

# Many customs and the traditional ways of behavior are no longer relevant to the modern life and no worth keeping. Do you agree or disagree?
Nowdays some people question ~about~ the value of customs and traditional behavioral standards, and think many customs and ~the~ traditional ways of behavior are ~no~**not** worth keeping. But it is hard to say that the ~option~**decision** of these people is right. I think everything has two sides.

~Firstly~**on one hand**, many traditions are worthy to **be** preserved in ~the~ modern society. **And** There are ~some~**certain** reasons. First, many traditions are part of history and culture. If people don't care about these traditions anymore, maybe the national sense of belonging would ~be~ disappear. For example we are proud of ~that we are~**being** Chinese because of we have the five thousand years of history and culture. Then there are many virtues and truths in traditional culture, just like respecting the old and cherishing the young and so on.

On the other hand, some of the traditional behaviors seem obsolete and incompatible with modern life. In the past, women ~are~**were** not allowed to receive education, and they ~are~**were** encouraged to stay at home especially when they were married in many regions. Also some ~oldr~ **older** people don't respect science and believe in superstition. ~Something~**Somethings** like these are ~no~**not** worth keeping.

To conclude, It is not right to keep all the traditional culture, or to remove all the traditional culture. We should treat ~it~**them** differently, keep these good parts and remove these bad parts.

# In many cities an increasing number of people do not know their neighbors and they lack a sense of community. What are the causes? How to solve this problem?
Nowadays, there is a ~more and more common~ phenomenon that is becoming more and more common that a neighbor is just like a stranger. Many of us do not know those who live next door, or never meet our neighbors. I think this problem is caused by two main reasons.

Firstly, the pace of life is fast, and we face more working pressure than before. We spend most of our time ~~on~**at** our job~~**working**. Everyday we work from dawn to night, And the time which we spend at home is becoming shorter. It is ~differently~**difficult** to meet each other.
Then, because of the development of information technology, online communication is becoming more and more popular. Especially young people like us are used to ~get~**geting** in touch with others via online communication tools, such as Wechat, QQ, Twitter and so on. These tools are making it possible to communicate with friends who are far away. They are addicted to the network, and unwilling to meet strangers in the real life. ~So~**therefore** it is hard to make friends with neighbors.

According to all of these reasons, we can take some measures to alleviate this problem. For example, the community committee or government should organize some interesting activities to attract more local residents, then ~you can~**they could** know each other. Also the mass media should spread the significance which encourages people to communicate and make friends with each other in the real life.

1. 生活节奏快，人们的空暇时间变少；  
2. 工作压力大，通勤时间长，在家的时间变短；
3. 信息科技的影响，人们沉迷于网络空间，忽略了面对面的交往。

 解决方案
 1. 社区组织丰富多彩的活动吸引人们参加。
 2. 政府和社区提供机会拉近邻里之间的距离，建立相互信任。

# Many people think cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people freedom to travel further. However , others think this lead to environmental problems, so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.

Cheap air travel makes it possible for us to across borders by lower price. I think cheap flights can benefit the masses, although we should avoid unnecessary journeys.

By flying to different countries, people can experience different cultures and broaden their horizons. Some people may get a better work opportunities and earn much higher salaries. Some businessmen can discover some business opportunities during their trip and earn profits by exporting or importing products. If the cost of ~flight~**flying** is higher, they may lose these opportunities.

At the same time, some people think that increasing the price of air service can reduce the environmental pollution by the airline industry. First, some people may cancel their travel plan by flight due to the higher price. Second, the greenhouse gas produced by flight can decrease if the amount of air flights can be limited. Lastly, other problems related to the aviation sector, including noise population and environmental destruction caused by the construction of airports and other facilities can also be mitigated.

In my opinion, it's unnecessary to increase the price because people should have opportunities to travel around the world. Most people today are very busy and under pressure, especially those who live in the big cities. If the air travel is cheaper, they can have vacations to some exotic locations or travel more ~times~**frequently** than before.  

In conclusion, my view is that restricting air travel is not reasonable, Air companies can reduce the strain on the environment by adopting technological innovations.

# Many people are moving from rural areas to big cities, why has this happened? To what extent do you think it's a good trend?

These days many people from rural areas have chosen to migrate to cities. They probably think it's more convenient to find **a** job in cities and living condition is much better there, but this trend would cause some problems.

People choose to live in cities because of two main reasons:

Firstly, the population in cities are more than in rural areas, and there are more job opportunities available, so people may earn more money. This means they can buy more products which may ~increase~**improve/enhance** their life experience. By ~contract~**contrast**, work opportunities in rural areas are much lower due to the fact that many industries there are under-developed. Another reason is that people living in cities can gain public services more easily, including education and healthcare.

However, the increasing of population in cities can put huge pressure on housing and facilities in the cities, and some of the cities are unable to accommodate large number of people because of the shortage of land. Lots of the migrants end up enduring poor living conditions because they cannot afford home ownership. People are prone to poor health because some facilities may not be able to meet the growing demand for clean water, dispose of household waste and manage sewage.

Another problem associated with rural-to-urban shift is the growing of rural-urban income disparity, not diminishing. Young people who are energetic, creative and hardworking prefer to go to cities for good education and employment opportunities. Thus, it's more difficult to develop **the** economy in rural areas due to the lack of labour. 

~According all above~**According to all of the above**, poor employment prospects and sluggish local economies have caused the population shift to big cities. This is a worrying trend in our society.

#Some people think that children should obey the rules or do what their parents want them to do. Other people think that children controlled to much cannot deal with problems themselves in adulthood. What is your opinion?

Sometimes children should obey the rules or accept ~these advices~**the advice** of their parents. But I think that we should not ask our children to do everything ~what~**that** ~we~**they** want. It ~will~**would/may** cause a lot of problems.

First these children may lack the ability to solve problems. Because their parents always told them how to **directly**  solve these problems or solved these peoblems ~directly~ for them. Maybe these children cannot solve these problems without any other's help. But these problems in the real world are very complex, Their parents or friends cannot help them to solve these problems, they should try to find a way to solve these prolems by themselves.

~Then~**As a result/after this/consequently** some children cannot live by themselves. Their parents arranged everything for ~their children~**them**. So some of them do not have their own goals

In my opinion, these parents can tell their children what is right and wrong. But when their children have some problems, they should encourage ~their children~**them** to solve these problems by themselves, And they should take responsiblity for their behaviours. They can understand better and improve themselves when they ~made~**make** mistakes, so I think ~make~**making** mistakes will be good for their grown.  As parents, they should encourage their children to do what they want and arranged their own life.

for/by themselves --> indepentently

# It is argued that we are living in a throw-away society: people throw away what they use in daily life, instead of recycling or reusing them. Why has this happened and how to address this issue?

Nowadays, people prefer to use things only once rather than **for** a long time. It is important to understand why this happened and how to solve this problem.

People's revenue keeps increasing thus they can buy a great number of products. And the revolution of technology ~deduces~**reduces** the cost of products which also improves people's productivity.   Some of the electronic products, like phones and computers can be brought at a lower price, **and** therefore people seldom repair them when they break down.  This is fairly common among younger people who like to buy the latest generation of these products and then drop old ones.

On the other hand, the lack of environmental awareness is another reason **why xxxx**. Many people don't realize their consumption habits may produce garbage and cause pollution.  They may not know these electronic products will end up in landfill sites which can destroy our environment.  They may also not know we can recycle them to make our lifestyle more effective.

As product overconsumption is pervasive, it is important to mitigate pollution. First, we need to enhance people's environmental awareness because this can change the way they use and handle these products.  Second, environmental ~group~**groups** should disseminate knowledge about how to recycle disposable products and household appliances.  Third, **the**government can enact some laws to control these behaviors. For example, government can tax disposable products to encourage people to use more environmental protection products.

In conclusion, people's attitude ~to~**toward** consumption and increasing of disposable income are the main reasons of overconsumption.  In order to resolve this issue, the top priority ~thing~ is to enhance the awareness of environmental protection, ~as~ thus people will change their lifestyle which will eventually improve our environment.

#Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post, TV, Internet, etc.) to study at home, but some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? 

Nowdays distance-learning programmes are more and more popular. Many people use them to learn ~what they want~ **topic what they interested**.

# Some people believe that children can learn effectively by watching TV and they should be encouraged watch TV both at home and at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Watching TV, especially informative television is recognized as an effective way of learning, because this information is tend to attract students' attention and develop their interest. Although many televisions are valuable for education, I don't agree with watching TV too much as being a student.

Watching TV may influence children's studying and some activities which can help them grow. It also distract children's attention, especially without their parent's supervision. Student watching TV too often may not be able focus on their learning tasks, this may lead to **the** descending of their test score. And some children may be hard when attending some interactive activites, like reading, sing and communication.
to find (sth) hard/difficult

Besides **this**, watching TV may affect children's health. They may spend a couple of hours in front of the TV without playing games or doing exercise with their friends. Because of ~lacking~ **lack of** exercise, they can have obesity problem, shortsightless and prone to feel tired. This cause that they do not have enough energy for their studying.(this causes them not to have)

On the other hand, television also helps children access a world of knowledge. Lots of TV programs are designed for children to help them increase their understanding in different subjects. For example, historical documentary gives them the details of history and language channels can help them learn foreign language. ~These knowledges are~**this knowledge is** the supplement for their study outside of the school.

In conclusion, ~parent~**parents** should impose restriction on watching TV, not encourage it. Watching TV too much will influence their study rather than improve their study performance.

#Fast food is developing more and more popular. It replaces other traditional food. Some people think it is good, some people disagree with it. What's your opinion about it. Give some reason of your opinion.

Nowadays we face a lot of ~life pressure~**pressures in life** and the pace of life is fast. So fast food is becoming more and more popular. It is so convenient. Fast food is a good choice when we have very little time to spend on eating. We can eat it as fast as we can and use less time than ~eat~**eating** normal food. For example we can eat it when we are walking or in the car.

However, in my opinion eating fast food is not good for our health. Most fast food is fried food. It is often rich in fat and ~calorie~**calories**, and it lacks many useful elements for our health. Eating too much fast food could make people ~obesity~**obes**.

If I have enough time, I prefer the traditional food. Traditional food is more delicious and ~more choice~**better choice**. It usually contains meat, vegetables, fruit or ~finish~**fish**. Its nutrition is more balanced. If ~I~**you** don't have enough time, I suggest to eat some noodle or dumplings. It also could save your time, and it is better than fast food.

For the reasons given above, I recommend that we should eat more traditional food than fast food.


#In many countries, the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. Does this trend have positive or negative effect on society?

Human life is continually increasing due to the development of technology and increase of social wealth. Although older people can contribute to our society, the demographic trend may cause a lot of problems.

One problem is aging population, which may cause the escalation of these health insurance fees. This can ~give Taxpayers a burden~**cause a burden on taxpayers**. And most of the medical needs and fees appear ~at~**in** the last year of life, **the** government has to spend a lot of money ~for caring~**to care for** older people, which may cause ~the~**a** lack of money in other areas,such as education.

**This can give taxpayers a burden, and most of the medical needs and fees appear in the last year of life. The government has to spend a lot of money to care for older people, which may case a lack of money in other areas, such as education.**
**In the (first, second, last, etc) year**

Second, the pace of work may be another problem as the ~number~**numbers** of older workers keep increasing. When humans become old, their ability of absorbing information will decline. This may affect the efficiency and revenue of a company.

On the other hand, many people may postpone their retirement and expand their working life, their experience and wisdom are treasures. They can impart their knowledge and skills to novices as being a consultant. For example, some senior managers can teach others how to manage a company and provide better service to customers .

Some people think reading stories in book is better than watching TV or playing computer games for children. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

I agree that reading stories in ~book~ **books** is better than watching TV or playing computer games for children.

In my opinion ~book~**the books** can help children learn many things. Especially these classic fairy tales or fables are trying to tell our children many ~principles~**nor story** or truths. For example, what is right ~or what is~**and** wrong, what kind of people we should be, and so on. On the other hand, I think reading book is a good habit~.~**,** And this habit can benefit for our life.

I think watching TV or playing computer games is just ~relax~**relaxing**. Many people spend a lot of time on it, but they can learn litte from it~.~**,** And it is likely to **cost** addiction. We can do it, but we should control the time. We should tell children to finish things ~what~**that** they should do, and then they can ~do some relax~**relax**.
For the reasons given above, I strongly recommend that we should help children develop reading ~habit~**habits**.


Question?
Some people think that children should obey the rules or do what their parents want them to do. Other people think that children controlled to much cannot deal with problems themselves in adulthood. What is your opinion?

Answer:
Usually, children should obey some rules at home or at school. Sometimes,strict discipline may be important, but I think this may affect their ability of tackling problems.

The main function of principal is make children to take ~responsible~**responsiblity** ~of~**for** their behaviours. They can't think like adult who know the results of their acts, but with rules, they may increasingly understand how to become a person accepted by the society. For example, children can learn how to show good manners and how to respect others. These are really important for their further life!

~But~**However**,sometimes, rules may cause some unexpected affects ~to~**on** children. They may not have **the** ability to solve problems by themselves if they always make decisions by obeying some rules. For example, some children may not be able to ~dominate~***how to use* times due to too much control of their parents, ~as to~**therefor** they don't know how to arrange their time on work when they grow up. So children may ~be hard~**find it hard** to succeed in their career life.

In my view, obeying rules would ~strict~**constrict** the imagination of children by which they could not try to solve problems by using different methods. Also, children wouldn't practice their ideas because of the punishment if they against a regulation. Seldom students will try to use different ~ways~**way** to solve the same question if they have been taught by one way. The problems in the real world are really complex, and people can not tackle them without imagination.

To catch up on  =>  do sth that should have been done earlier implies that you can behind on this thing

To end up with => in the end, you have this(sth)
Ex. I worked late on Friday, and ended up with 10 hours of overtime.
To end up + verb phrase
Ex. We ended up going to the movies.

To follow through  => do what is necessary to complete sth or make it successful
Ex. The president promised to improve the economy, but he did not follow through.
Ex. Make sure you follow through with this project and complete it well.

To hold up(non phrase) => to prevent sth from happening/being completed
Ex. What's the hold up? ==> What is causing a deploy?
Ex. The rain is holding up people from getting to work.

It tends to expose them to sth

They can keep in touch ---> it allows them to keep in touch
We should tell what is right, and give them the opportunity to learn for themselves.

What do you think of relationship between talent and effort?

Well, although talent and effort are both very important，I think ~there isn't any necessary~there isn't necessarily any  relationship between them.
Some one may think that talent is the precondition for one's success, but this depends on different situations. For example, if I were a basketball player, it's true that my height talent would help me a lot ~for my career~for work/in my career, or if I were higher than most of the people, than I would have much more opportunities to become a basketball player!
But according to the newest research, nearly ~every one~everyone can become expert by deliberate practice, which means effort is much more important than talent! Take violin as an example, if you use a well designed practice and there is a good teacher who can give you positive ~response~feedback to help you correct your practice continually, then you can ~get~achieve success in violin area.
So, to summarize, talent is not the precondition in some of the ~areas~fields now, effort and deliberate practice is much more important for us to become an expert.
