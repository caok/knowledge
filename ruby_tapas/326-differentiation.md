First, when diving into a new problem domain, we need to embrace specific, concrete examples of domain artifacts. After all, that’s all we’re likely to find. We should collect as many as we can get our hands on.

当我们接触到一个新的问题领域时，我们需要去拥抱该领域产品的详细具体的例子.毕竟，这些就是我们很可能发现的。我们应该尽可能收集我们能收集到的。

Then, we should find a domain expert, and show them the examples. We should then ask them a very important question: “Is this the same as that“.
然后，我们应该找到一个该领域的专家，去展示这些我们找到的例子，并向他们询问一个很重要的问题：“这些相同吗？”

The best answer we can get is “no”. When a domain expert tells us that one example is different from another, we get to ask the most important question of all: “why not?“. Or, phrased a different way, “what makes this different from that?”
It is this key question that enables us to begin to discover the distinctions between domain concepts. It enables us to understand which differences are coincidental and unimportant, and which differences are fundamental. And in this process of differentiation, we often discover the all-important names for discrete concepts—names like Pin Oak, and Chestnut Oak.

通过这些问题，使我们开始发现该领域中一些概念的区别。它也使我们明白哪些区别是巧合和不重要的，哪些区别是基础.在这样区分的过程中，我们经常会发现重要的但不相关的概念的名词


Which brings us to our second lesson: we shouldn’t cling too tightly to the first names we discover for concepts. Very often, those initial names turn out to be over-broad for the specific examples we attach them to. We should seek diligently to narrow the names for concepts we identify. For instance, the term “Oak” is incomplete if it is applied to a class that encodes details that are specific to Chestnut Oaks.
第二个教训: 我们不应该太过于执着于我们刚开始寻找该概念得到的一些名次，往往这些我们一开始得到的最初的名字被证明过于宽泛了。我们应该努力寻求缩小，使得我们针对某概念定义的名字更加的精确

The third and final lesson we can take from today’s example is that the class hierarchies which appear to emerge from this process of differentiation at the very beginning often turn out to be wrong, or at best incomplete. Encoding these flawed assumptions about the structure of the domain into our code can set us up for a lot of confusion and re-work down the road.
早期的在区分的过程中出现的类层次结构一般被证实为错误的，或事不完善的。将这些对领域结构有缺陷的假设写入到我们的代码中的话， 会给我们带来更多的困惑和re-work
